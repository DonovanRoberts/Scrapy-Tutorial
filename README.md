<h1> üï∑Ô∏èScrapy Tutorial "Chocolate Spider" üç´</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
Before we get started, this tutorial was run on Python 3.10.10 in Anaconda. The purpose of this package 
is to utilize Scrapy. Scrapy is a Python program that enables the user to send, sniff and dissect and forge 
network packets. This capability allows construction of tools that can probe, scan or attack networks. For 
your knowledge a network packet in simple terms is a unit of data transferred over a computer network. 
In this tutorial I will walk you through utilizing scrapy to walk through a website and gather data from 
that website by creating a Spider. For this specific tutorial we will be walking through a chocolate 
website, chocolate.co.uk. However, this tutorial can be applied to numerous websites like Walmart, 
Amazon, Liquor stores, and much more.
